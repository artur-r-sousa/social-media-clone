# ReadME, Introduction and Presentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Why I chose Spring and React

Spring offers a very robust and safe way to handle the necessities of this project. I could use redux or context api, but I want this project to mantain its data and represent an enterprise project.
React with bootstrap because it's a fairly direct way of building web applications, and I plan on also creating a mobile version, so by using react I'll reduce the amount of code needed when working with React-Native.
